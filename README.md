# Swift Projects Repository

Welcome to my Swift Projects repository! This repository houses a collection of projects I've developed using Swift. From iOS applications to utility tools, these projects showcase my proficiency in Swift programming and passion for building innovative solutions.

## Projects Included

1. **Caesar's Cipher**: The Caesar cipher functions by substituting each letter in the plaintext with another letter in a consistent number of positions along the alphabet.
   - Features:
     - Loops through the alphabet, replaces the letters in a message and shifts down three letters from the original letter.   
     - Encrypts and decrypts messages from a String input.  
   - Caesar's Cipher was made and run in CodeCademy!

2. **Magic 8-Ballt**: Uses Swift switch statement conditionals and the Swift random number function to generate responses randomly, like a Magic-8 Ball. 
   - Features:
     - Ask the Magic-8 Ball a question via string input in the code
     - See the responses generated each time you run the program and ask a question.
   - The Magic-8 ball code was made and ran in Codecademy!
  
3. **Morse Decoder**: Uses Swift switch statement conditionals and the Swift random number function to generate responses randomly, like a Magic-8 Ball. 
   - Features:
     - Ask the Magic-8 Ball a question via string input in the code
     - See the responses generated each time you run the program and ask a question.
   - The Magic-8 ball code was made and ran in Codecademy!

4. *The remaining projects are to be added soon!*
