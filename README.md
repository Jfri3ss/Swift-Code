# Swift Projects Repository

Welcome to my Swift Projects repository! This repository houses a collection of projects I've developed using Swift. From iOS applications to utility tools, these projects showcase my proficiency in Swift programming and passion for building innovative solutions.

## Projects Included

1. **Caesar's Cipher**: The Caesar cipher functions by substituting each letter in the plaintext with another letter in a consistent number of positions along the alphabet.
   - Features:
     - Loops through the alphabet, replaces the letters in a message and shifts down three letters from the original letter.   
     - Encrypts and decrypts messages from a String input.  
   - Caesar's Cipher was made and run in CodeCademy!

2. **Magic 8-Ballt**: This method uses Swift switch statement conditionals and the Swift random number function to generate responses randomly, like a Magic-8 Ball. 
   - Features:
     - Ask the Magic-8 Ball a question via string input in the code
     - See the responses generated each time you run the program and ask a question.
   - The Magic-8 ball code was made and ran in Codecademy!
  
3. **Morse Decoder**: This program uses loops to decode Morse Code into English and introduces Libraries in Swift.   
   - Features:
     - Input a code Morse code syntax with dots and dashes.    
     - Run the program to see if the decoded text is interpreted in English. 
   - The Morse Decoder code was made and ran in Codecademy!

4. **Exercise**: This program uses loops to decode Morse Code into English and introduces Libraries in Swift.   
   - Features:
     - Input a code Morse code syntax with dots and dashes.    
     - Run the program to see if the decoded text is interpreted in English. 
   - The Morse Decoder code was made and ran in Codecademy!
  
5. **Quadratic Equation**: This program uses loops to decode Morse Code into English and introduces Libraries in Swift.   
   - Features:
     - Input a code Morse code syntax with dots and dashes.    
     - Run the program to see if the decoded text is interpreted in English. 
   - The Morse Decoder code was made and ran in Codecademy!
  
6. **Pokedex**: This program uses loops to decode Morse Code into English and introduces Libraries in Swift.
